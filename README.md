# YOLO Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) model. The system identifies and classifies objects in images or video streams in real-time, based on the YOLO architecture. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can recognize multiple objects in a single pass through the neural network.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use YOLOv5 to perform object detection on various datasets. You can either use the pre-trained weights or train your own model on a custom dataset.

YOLOv5 is fast and accurate, and it is an efficient object detection algorithm well-suited for real-time detection tasks in applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and retail analysis.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Multi-class object detection
- Easy-to-use interface for inference
- Support for custom training datasets
- Configurable thresholds for detection confidence and non-max suppression
